Everything that happens on the web interface goes through a [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)-based API.

This API is designed to be callable from both [server-side](https://trpc.io/docs/server-side-calls) code (e.g. for server-side rendering of wiki pages) and from the browser.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth). Users [sign in with GitHub through Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/github-auth), and Firebase SDK handles the authentication state (such as storing and rotating ID tokens).

To call the API from the frontend, [use `await auth.currentUser?.getIdToken()` to obtain the current userâ€™s ID token](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#retrieve_id_tokens_on_clients) and send it to the wiki engine via the `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` HTTP header.
