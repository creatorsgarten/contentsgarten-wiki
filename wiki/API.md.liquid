::: lead

Everything that happens on the web interface goes through a [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)-based API.

:::

This API is designed to be callable from both [server-side](https://trpc.io/docs/server-side-calls) code (e.g. for server-side rendering of wiki pages) and from the browser.

## Authentication

Contentsgarten uses [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to handle authentication.

- Users [sign in with GitHub through Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/github-auth).
- Firebase SDK handles the authentication state in the client side (such as storing and rotating ID tokens).
- When invoking APIs, the frontend [obtains the ID token](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#retrieve_id_tokens_on_clients) from the Firebase SDK and sends it to the API as a Bearer token.
