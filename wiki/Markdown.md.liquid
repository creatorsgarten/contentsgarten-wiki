Contentsgarten supports Markdown with a few extensions inspired by [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html).
:::

It uses [micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) under the hood.

## Custom containers

The syntax is different from VitePress â€” there must be no space between `:::` and the directive name.

:::info

:::

:::tip
This is a tip.

:::warning
This is a warning.
:::

:::danger
This is a dangerous warning.
:::

:::details
