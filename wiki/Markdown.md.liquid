Contentsgarten is markup language agnostic. However, a library `@contentsgarten/markdown` is provided as an opiniated Markdown renderer, with a few syntax extensions inspired by [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/).

It uses [micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) under the hood.
