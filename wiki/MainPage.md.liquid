**Contentsgarten** is a modern, cloud-native wiki engine.

**Project status:** Currently just an idea... Not usable yet.

## Goals

- Contents stored on GitHub repo, accessed and manipulated using Octokit (using GitHub App or Personal Access Token).
- Write Markdown. Rendered using `markdown-it` with similar configuration as VitePress with Tailwind Typography.
- Pages can include templates using Liquid tags.
- Users authenticate via GitHub, through Firebase.
- Headless (API-only) mode available.
