**Contentsgarten** is a modern, cloud-native wiki engine. Check out the [UseCases](/wiki/UseCases) for why it is created.

**Project status:** Currently has a bare bones, incomplete and janky implementation... The wiki engine has been extracted out of [Creatorsgarten website](https://github.com/creatorsgarten/creatorsgarten.org) and [Directcommit](https://github.com/dtinth/directcommit) codebases. However it is not used in production anywhere yet. Once this becomes mature enough, the plan is to migrate the website to use it. Still not sure if that will ever happen, though.

## Goals

- ✅ Contents stored on GitHub repo, accessed and manipulated using Octokit (using GitHub App or Personal Access Token).
- ✅ Write Markdown. Rendered using `markdown-it` with Tailwind Typography.
- Pages can include templates using Liquid tags.
- ✅ Users authenticate via GitHub, through Firebase.
- Allowed users can make changes to the wiki page through the web interface if the access control rules allows for it, even if the user does not have write access to the repo. (This effectively skips the pull request and invitation workflows.)
- Headless (API-only) mode available.
