When developing locally, there are multiple approaches:

1. Develop the frontend only and use the production backend.

   ```
   BACKEND=https://contentsgarten.netlify.app
   ```

2. Develop both the frontend and backend, but use fake implementations of 3rd party services.

   ```
   BACKEND=fake
   ```

3. Develop both the frontend and backend, using real services. (This is the default setting.)

   ```
   BACKEND=real
   ```
