When developing locally, there are multiple mode of operation:

1. Develop the frontend only and use the production backend.

   ```
   BACKEND=https://contentsgarten.netlify.app
   ```

   - Pro: You can develop the frontend against real, production data, without having to configure any secret key or credential.
   - Con: You cannot work on backend under this mode.

2. Develop both the frontend and backend, but use fake implementations of 3rd party services.

   ```
   BACKEND=fake
   ```

   - Pro: You can develop both frontend and backend without having to configure any secret key or credential.
   - Pro: You can run system-level testing against it, and it will run very fast (because test doubles are used in place of 3rd party dependencies)
   - Con: You donâ€™t have the confidence that the app would work when integrated with the 3rd third party services.

3. Develop both the frontend and backend, using real services. (This is the default setting.)

   ```
   BACKEND=real
   ```

   - Pro: You have the highest confidence that your code will work correctly when integrated.
   - Con: Takes some effort to set up. Requires setting up a GitHub app, a GitHub repo, a GitHub App installation, as well as a Redis instance.
