Contentsgarten may be a good fit if:

- You want to create a collaborative digital garden in a form of a wiki.
- You want a custom wiki system that runs on serverless compute, without having to manage any server.
- You want to write your wiki contents as flat plain-text files, in Markdown language, rather than in some custom wikitext syntax.
- You want to retain complete control over your data in your GitHub repository.
- You want to let other trusted people (who have a GitHub account) contribute content to your wiki through a simple web interface, without requiring them to go through the pull request or invitation workflows.
- You want your wiki to have advanced features that tools like Notion, Confluence, or GitHub Wiki does not provide.
- You want people to be able to edit the wiki contents from Git directly if they choose to.
- You want your wiki site to be updated instantly when someone edits it, without having to wait for rebuilding the site.

Contentsgarten may **not** be a good fit if:

- You want a real-time WYSIWYG editing experience. In that case, use something like Notion.
- You want a stable, battle-tested tool that scales. In that case, try MediaWiki, PmWiki, or DokuWiki.
- You want a wiki that can be edited by anyone, even those whom you donâ€™t trust. In order to gain flexibility while retaining simplicity, this wiki does not sanitize the contents.
- You want to allow people to log in using something other than a GitHub account.
