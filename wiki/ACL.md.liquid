Write access to the wiki can be controlled in two ways:

1. **Wiki policy.** This can be configured in the configuration file and applies to the whole wiki.

2. **Page ACL.** This applies to individual pages. For example, you can add editors to a specific page to grant them access.

Permissions:

- `edit` - Can edit the page contents and its front-matter. However some front-matter keys are reserved and require extra permissions to edit.

  - `manage_editors` â€” Can edit the `acl`.
