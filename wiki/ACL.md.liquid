Write access to the wiki can be controlled in two ways:

1. **Wiki policy.** This can be configured in the configuration file and applies to the whole wiki.

2. **Page ACL.** This applies to individual pages. For example, you can add editors to a specific page to grant them access.

Policy structure:

- `permission`
- `userId`
- `userIdNot`
- `team`
- `page`
- `pageNot`
- `frontmatterKey`
- `frontmatterKeyNot`

Permissions:

- `edit` - Can edit the page content and its front-matter. 
  - `editContent` — Can edit the content but not its front-matter.
- `clearCache` — Can clear the server-side cache.
