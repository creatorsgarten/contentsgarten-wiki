Write access to the wiki can be controlled in two ways:

1. **Wiki policy.** This can be configured in the configuration file and applies to the whole wiki.

2. **Page ACL.** This applies to individual pages. For example, you can add editors to a specific page to grant them access.

Policy structure:

- `userId`
- `team`
- `page`
- `frontmatterKey`

Permissions:

- `edit` - Can edit the page contents and its front-matter. 
  - `editContents` â€” Can edit the contents but not its front-matter.
