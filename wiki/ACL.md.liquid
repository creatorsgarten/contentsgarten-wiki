Write access to the wiki can be controlled by adding policies to `contentsgarten.config.yml`.

Policy structure:

- `name` — Name of the policy
- `permission` — Permission to grant
- `userId` — User ID(s) to explicitly grant
- `userIdNot` — Prevent the policy from applying in matched user ID(s)
- `team` — Organization slug and team slug (`org_slug/team_slug`) to grant if user is inside that team
- `page` — Filter the policy to only apply on specific page(s)
- `pageNot` — Prevent the policy from applying on specific page(s)
- `frontmatterKey` — (unimplemented)
- `frontmatterKeyNot` — (unimplemented)

Permissions:

- `edit` - Can edit the page content and its front-matter. 
  - `editContent` — Can edit the content but not its front-matter.
- `clearCache` — Can clear the server-side cache. (unimplemented)
